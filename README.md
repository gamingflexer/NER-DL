# Introduction

This repository contains a simple example of how to us spacy and transformers to perform NER. As we known NER is rather comples than simple classification tasks, Also as the entites increase the complexity of the task increases. In this example we will use BERT to extract +20 entities from the text.

# Table of Contents

- BERT & Works on Other transformers Models also 
- Spacy - v2
- Spacy - v3

Research was done for Resume parsing which generally contains more than 25+ entities to detect. These scripts are tuned for smaller datasets with larger entities.

Hope it helps you !
